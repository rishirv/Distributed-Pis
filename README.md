Connect GPIO pin 23 to D5 on ESP8266

Ben's Version of shit as he does weird developing things that a person who knew what they were doing would totally do because he totally knows what he is doing .... don't question it. 


Other-Stuff: All the stuff that was in main before I started messing with it. 
Projects: Basically like 'labs' in class repo except project pieces, each folder is a feature being developed. 
Libpi: same as before, but slowly changing headers/adding appropriate sources when each part is complete.
