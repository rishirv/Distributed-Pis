Ooooookay we need some more stuff on the esp: 

A. we need to figure out a list to keep on the server ... more or less we need to keep a list of connections.. not sure how that rolls 

B. Need to write code to grab data from server/client on esp and send to pi.... shit hows that gonna go? ... Okay lazy sending: we can assume reliable transfers btwn esps, so literally just buffer up 32 and send it. dunno how much we can buffer but itll be alright. 
C. need to make a connect to wifi one

D. Need to make one to actually send the commmand, just makes sure its connected first or handles the resulting fail. 

E. Make a switch case for the commands on the esp side. 

F Basically write all the recieve end on the pi.

Okay next level

Add interrupts: 

scan the interrupts from my thread scheduler
pull over what is necessary to handle an IRQ 

Go look at past code... do we have interrupts on falling edge anywhere?
