A simple distributed shell to dynamically send processes to clients
Current thoughts: just support a couple basic command
`list`
List all pis on the network
`run prog_name.bin id1 id2 ...`
Run the program on the specified pis
`update [id]`
Get updates on the status / output of all programs currently running
